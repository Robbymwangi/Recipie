                <p id = "pasta-description" class = "description">This easy pasta sauce will cook in about the same time it takes to cook some dried pasta in boiling salted water – we’re talking about quick and easy options here. These amounts serve 2 but are easy to scale up or down. Remember you want about 75g of dried pasta per person – use whatever shape you’ve got. Or, check out my super-simple method for fresh pasta, using just flour and water.</p>

                <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Cook the pasta in a pan of boiling salted water according to the packet instructions.
                    </li>
                    <li class = "red-text"> Slice the bacon and place in a non-stick frying pan on a medium heat with half a tablespoon of olive oil and a really good pinch of black pepper. Leave it to get super-golden and crispy, tossing occasionally, then turn off the heat.</li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, beat the eggs in a bowl, then finely grate in the Parmesan and mix well.
                    </li>
                    <li>Use tongs to transfer your pasta straight into the pan and toss.
                    </li>
                    <li>Pour the Parmesan eggs into the pan, and keep everything moving, loosening with splashes of the pasta cooking water until you have a silky sauce. Make sure the pan is not too hot otherwise the eggs will scramble.</li>
                    <li>Plate up the pasta, and finish with an extra grating of Parmesan.
                    </li>
                </ol>
